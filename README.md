## DigiKeyboard and Arduino IDE

The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller, and a bit less powerful.
You need to install the Arduino IDE first, then set up the right environment for your ATTiny85 microcontroller.

When your script is compiling, don't forget to upload your script before plugging in your device, the terminal will inform you that you have 60 seconds to plug in your microcontroller. My scripts are written for UK keyboards. Adapt to suit your own.

I wrote these scripts for the ATTiny85 development boards, but they can easily be reverse engineered to suit your needs.
